# backtesting_api_

This is an ongoing personal project to build an API that allows me to interact with vectorbtpro in a more succinct, user friendly way in order to allow complex strategy development to be done with straight forward string definitions

This allows us a great deal of power in testing many different strategies with very deep, data rich results.

This project employs Optuna to handle the hyperparameters of our backtests to remove the need for long lists of manually defined parameters and allows us to test an extremely high number of different parameter combinations without becoming unbearably slow.
